## Preface

This article describes how to use the components provided by Frosti in `mdx` to realize the functions that can't be realized by normal `md`.

## Main text

### Getting started

First you need to create an `mdx` file, which is as simple as changing the extension to `.mdx`.

### Introducing

The components provided by Frosti are placed in the `/blog` and `/page` folders. Write something under the document properties (frontmatter):

```astro
import Collapse from "../../components/blog/collapse.astro";
import Diff from "../../components/blog/diff.astro";
import Error from "../../components/blog/error.astro";
import Info from "../../components/blog/info.astro";
import Kbd from "../../components/blog/kbd.astro";
import Success from "../../components/blog/success.astro";
import Warning from "../../components/blog/warning.astro";
import TimeLine from "../../components/page/TimeLine.astro";
import LinkCard from "../../components/page/LinkCard.astro";
```

### Example

#### Collapse

<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
  This is the hidden content!
</Collapse>

```astro
<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
